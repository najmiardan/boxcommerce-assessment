# BoxCommerce Assessment â€“ Selenium Python

Automates the sign-up flow on BoxCommerce UAT.

## Framework, Tools, and Libraries Used

- **Selenium**: Automates browser actions for end-to-end testing of the signup flow.
- **pytest**: Provides a simple, scalable test runner and fixtures for Python.
- **webdriver-manager**: Automatically downloads and manages browser drivers for Selenium.
